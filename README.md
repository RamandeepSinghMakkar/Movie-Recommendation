# Movie-Recommendation
MYSQL, NLP, Streamlit, webAPI
This Movie Recommendation System suggests movies based on the userâ€™s input, provides in-depth details of selected movies, and saves user interactions to a MySQL database for further personalization.

### 1. Movie Recommendation Based on User Input
When a user searches for a movie (e.g., "Spider-Man 3"), the system recommends similar movies using NLP-based similarity matching.

###4. MySQL Database Integration
All user activity, including search history and recommended movies, is stored in a MySQL database.

Each action is linked to a unique user ID (default ID: 1).

The system can be scaled to support multiple users, allowing for personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
