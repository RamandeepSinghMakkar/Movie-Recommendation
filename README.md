# Movie-Recommendation
(Setup codes are given in 
This project implements a movie recommendation system that not only suggests movies based on user searches but also provides in-depth movie details and cast information. User interactions, including search queries and recommendations, are logged into a MySQL database, allowing the system to be trained and improved over time. By default, the system uses a single user ID (1), but it is structured for future scalability.

### Technologies Used:

MySQL â€“ Database for storing user search data and recommendations

NLP â€“ Natural Language Processing to analyze movie similarity and user preferences

Streamlit â€“ Fast and interactive web application framework

WebAPI â€“ External APIs to fetch movie details and metadata

# Features

### 1. Movie Recommendation Based on User Input
On searching for a movie (e.g., "Spider-Man 3"), similar movies are suggested based on NLP similarity matching.

### 4. MySQL Database Integration
All user activity, including search history and recommended movies, is stored in a MySQL database.
Each action is linked to a unique user ID (default ID: 1).
